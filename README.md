# The PISA 2012 Dataset

## Dataset

> PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It focuses on examining how well the students have learned the school curriculum and how well prepared the students are for life beyond school.

> Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.


## Summary of Findings

> - There was a high-level of performance among the students with differences in grades being minimal

> - The assessment was not gender-biased and nothing could split male and female students in terms of academic performance

> - Parental influence was strong, as those with degrees groomed students who performed better academically. Although, non-natives whose parents had no degrees were also high-achievers.

> - Number of students in a class did not affect academic performance

> - Longer hours of learning did not equate better academic performance


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I focused on the bivariate exploration with emphasis on the variables affecting students grades such as correlation between their averages and parental influence
